This repository contains the code for equation discovery of the dynamic vibration of a single beam. It also contains data.csv, which contains the data that we generated for the beam with 100 nodes over 2000 time steps spanning a time of 2 seconds.
Furthermore, it contains the code for model predictive control of the beam using the discovered model. Two animations are also included for comparison and verification of the result in the 'Model Predictive Control' folder.
